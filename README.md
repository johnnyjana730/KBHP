This repository is the implementation of KBHP:
> Chang-You Tai, and Lun-Wei Ku. SIGIR 2021. KBHP: Knowledge Based Hyperbolic Propagation


## Introduction
We propose the knowledge basedhyperbolic propagation framework (KBHP), a KG-aware recommendation model which includes hyper-bolic components for calculating the importance of KG attributesâ€™ relatives to achieve better knowledge propagation.

## Files in the folder

- `data/`: datasets
  - `MovieLens-1M/`
  - `amazon-book_20core/`
  - `last-fm_50core/`
  - `music/`
- `src/model/`: implementation of KBHP.
- `output/`: storing log files
- `misc/`: storing users being evaluating, popular items, and sharing embeddings.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* tensorflow == 1.12.0
* numpy == 1.15.4
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.20.0

## Build Environment(conda)
```
$ cd KBHP
$ conda deactivate
$ conda env create -f requirements.yml
$ conda activate KBHP
```

## Example to Run the Codes

* KBHP
```
$ cd bash
$ bash bash_run.sh $dataset $gpu
```

* other baseline models, pls refer to (https://github.com/johnnyjana730/MVIN)

* `dataset`
  * It specifies the dataset.
  * Here we provide three options, including  * `az`, `mv`, `la`, or `mu`.

* `gpu`
  * It specifies the gpu, e.g. * `0`, `1`, and `2`.

# Issue

* `main_run.sh syntax error near unexpected token elif`
```
$ sed -i -e 's/\r$//' *.sh
```
